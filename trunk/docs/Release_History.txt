Breaking change.

In the Jobcenter client, calls the module makes on the ModuleInterfaceResponse response object
to add run messages and run output parameters will throw exceptions 
if the Strings passed cannot be marshaled and unmarshaled as UTF-8 XML.

The existing methods 'addRunMessage' and 'addRunOutputParam' remain on ModuleInterfaceResponse and throw checked exceptions.

New methods have been added to ModuleInterfaceResponse to automatically change the strings 

See the class 
/JobCenter_Client_Module_Interface/src/org/jobcenter/job_client_module_interface/ModuleInterfaceResponse.java
for changes to the existing methods adding checked exceptions and the new methods.



1.4

Important bug fix.

In rare instances, the job sent to the client was missing it's parameters.
Now that is detected in the server when it pulls the job for the client and will do a retry after a 5 second delay.
Other jobs will be sent as requested during that 5 second delay.
The client will also detect when the number of job parameters does not match the number initially on the job and will do a soft error
if an error is detected. 


New server will work with existing client from 1.0.2 onward, although it is recommended to get the bug fix in the latest client.

1.1.1

Bug fixes related to client status.
Fix is in server code only.  
New server will work with existing client from 1.0.2 onward.

  This will fix emails getting generated when the client isn't really late.
  The overage for being late was being set to zero due to missing an int to float conversion.
