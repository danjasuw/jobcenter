
The system configuration SQL is in the "schema" folder.

The file you will need is "database_system_configuration_population.sql".

Make a copy of the file and update the file replacing all the "***" with actual values and updating other values if necessary.
The actual configuration value is the last string in single quotes "'" on each line.
The single quotes have to be retained and the value entered inside cannot contain single quotes.


These values should only need to change if you want to receive email notification that the client has failed to check in.


       This value should only need to change if the computer the server is running on is not running a SMTP mail service.

           'client.checkin.notification.smtp.email.host', 'localhost' - IP address of the SMTP email server

    'client.checkin.notification.from.email', '***' - From email address for the email
    'client.checkin.notification.to.email', '***') - To email address for the email
