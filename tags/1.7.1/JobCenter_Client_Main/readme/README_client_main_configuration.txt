
The JobCenter client needs to be configured by copying the file

jobcenter_client_code/client_main/config_sample_files/config_client_main.properties

to the directory

jobcenter_client_code/client_main/config


Then configure the number of threads to run jobs on and how often to check for jobs in that copy of the file in the "config" directory.
