1.7

Breaking change.

In the Jobcenter client, calls the module makes on the ModuleInterfaceResponse response object
to add run messages and run output parameters will throw exceptions 
if the Strings passed cannot be marshaled and unmarshaled as UTF-8 XML.

The existing methods 'addRunMessage' and 'addRunOutputParam' remain on ModuleInterfaceResponse and throw checked exceptions.

New methods have been added to ModuleInterfaceResponse to automatically change the strings 

See the class 
/JobCenter_Client_Module_Interface/src/org/jobcenter/job_client_module_interface/ModuleInterfaceResponse.java
for changes to the existing methods adding checked exceptions and the new methods.
