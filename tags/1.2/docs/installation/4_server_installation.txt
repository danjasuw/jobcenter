
The Job Center server is a Java web application packaged as a "war" designed to run in a Java application server like Tomcat.

The application context name can be changed if necessary.
The application context name is not used in the server code.
The application context name will be needed when configuring the client.

A database connection pool is required at the JNDI name "jdbc/jobcenter".
The JNDI name can be changed in the Spring configuration, but only change it if you understand.

Example for Tomcat6
This resource needs to be added to the context.xml file in the conf directory of your tomcat installation.
"jdbc/jobcenter" is the JDNI name in this example.

	  <Resource		name="jdbc/jobcenter"
	  					auth="Container"
                        type="javax.sql.DataSource"
                        factory="org.apache.tomcat.dbcp.dbcp.BasicDataSourceFactory"
                        maxActive="100"
                        maxIdle="30"
                        maxWait="10000"
                        username="jobcenter"
                        password="jobcenter"
                        driverClassName="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"
						url="jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/jobcenter?autoReconnect=true&amp;useUnicode=true&amp;characterEncoding=UTF-8&amp;characterSetResults=UTF-8"/>
