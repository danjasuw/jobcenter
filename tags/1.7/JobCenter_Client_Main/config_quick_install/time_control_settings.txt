#   Client Time control file:   time_control_settings.txt


##  !!!!!!!!  Special version for Quick install.  Time control is not active since all entries are commented out  !!!!!!!!



#
#    This file is used to control what blocks of time the client will request jobs from the server.
#
#    If no blocks of time are specified (all are commented out), or if this file is not in the config folder,
#    the client will request jobs all the time.
#
#    The blocks of time specify when the client will request jobs.  Jobs that are running on the client when a block of time
#    has ended will continue to run to completion.  If jobs need to be complete by a specific time, will
#    need to take into account the longest running job when setting the end time for the block of time before that specific time.
#
#    A comment line has "#" as first position of the line
#
#    The format of a data line is:   dayOfWeek   start_time     end_time
#
#    The parameters are separated by white space ( space or tab ).
#
#    In specifying "dayOfWeek", enough of the name needs to be there to be unique(not match any other day of the week.  ie.  'SU' but not 'S'.
#          Whether the letters are upper or lower case does not matter.
#
#    A special case for "dayOfWeek" is the value "*", which indicates that the times following it apply to every day of the week.
#
#    Time as HH:MM where HH is a 24 hour clock.  Midnight at the beginning is 0.  Midnight at the end is 24.
#    if end time is before start time, it is assumed to be the next day
#
#    Overlapping day/time values are allowed.
# 

#    Some examples:

#  set up to run 6pm to 6am every day

# *  18:00  6:00

#  set up to run all day Sunday

# Sun   0      24

#  set up to run all day Saturday

# Sat   0      24

#  set up to run 3am to 8am Tuesday
