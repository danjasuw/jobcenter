
The client produces log files to help with tracking what is happening with the client and diagnosing problems.
Modules can also produce log files.

The client and the provided modules write log files in the "logs" directory under the root directory of the client installation.

The files with "errors" in the filenames contain only errors which usually need to be addressed.
