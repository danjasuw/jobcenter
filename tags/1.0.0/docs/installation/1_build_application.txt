Building the system

Check out the project into a directory.

The application is built with "ant"

Ensure "ant" is installed and on the PATH or prepend the command with the path to "ant".

Use "ant" to build the project (build file is "ant_build_all_JobCenter.xml").
The command is:
        ant -f ant_build_all_JobCenter.xml

The deployable files will be in the "deploy" directory.
     The client is in "jobcenter_client_installation.jar".

Copy the JobCenter_Server_Jersey.war that you will find in the 'deploy' directory to the appropriate folder of your application server
Example: tomcat/webapps/ for tomcat
